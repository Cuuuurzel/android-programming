		<h3> Android SDK </h3>
		The Android software development kit (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of development tools.<br>
		These include libraries, documentation, sample code, and tutorials.<br>
		The SDK also contains a Debugger Tool ( ADB ) and an Android emulator for x86 systems. <br>
		Obvioulsly, there also are tools for packing application, as explained in the next charapter.<br>

		<h3> Android NDK </h3>
		The NDK is a toolset that allows you to implement parts of your app using native-code languages such as C and C++. <br>
		This can be helpful in reusing existing code libraries written in these languages. <br>
		Most apps don't need the Android NDK.

		<h3> Android Debug Bridge </h3>
		The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a toolkit included in the Android SDK package. <br>
		It consists of both client and server-side programs that communicate each other via USB. <br>
		A typical use consist of compile a project and run it directly on a physical device. 

		<h3> ADT Bundle </h3>
		ADT Bundle is the "official" IDE for Android development, base on Eclipse. <br>
		I has been create to maintain the same interface of different OS and to keep togheter all the mentioned softwares. <br>
		
		<h3> Project Sections </h3>
		The project folder contains three main directory :
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Gen</b>,<br>
				which contains Java Library automatically generated. <br>
				In particular, an "R.java" file, containing exadecimal values referreing to gui elements.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Src</b>,<br>
				which contains the source code of the application. <br>
				It corresponds to the Java default source package. <br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Res</b>,<br>
				which contains all the resources used by the application. <br>
				Its subdirectory, "drawable", contains all the graphics resource such as image and so on. <br>
				The GUI Layout is defined in a xml file, contained in this directory.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<h3> Activity </h3>
					<div class="strong"> The concept </div>
					An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. <br>
					Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of managing graphics resources. <br>
					Every application is build around a single instance of the Activity class. <br>
<<<<<<< HEAD
					All the activity classes must have a corresponding <activity> tag in their package's manifest file. <br><br>

					<div class="strong"> Some Methods </div>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<b>onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onDestroy(), ...</b> <br>
							As easy to understand, these are methods used to interact with the flow of the application lifecycle. <br>
							Override these methods to initialize it on start or commmit modifications when exiting.
						</li>

						<li> 
<<<<<<< HEAD
							<b> setContentView() </b> <br>
							Set the activity content to an explicit view. <br>
							This view is placed directly into the activity's view hierarchy. <br>
							It can itself be a complex view hierarchy.

							<b> setContentView() </b>
							Set the activity content to an explicit view. <br>
							This view is placed directly into the activity's view hierarchy. It can itself be a complex view hierarchy. <br>
							Parameters :
							<ul>
								<li> view: the desired content to display. </li>
								<li> params: layout parameters for the view. </li>
							</ul>

							<b> onActivityResult() </b>

							Let's suppose an application needs the user to select a contact from the contect list. <br>
							Calling another application is as simple as this : <br>
<pre class="code">
startActivityForResult(
    new Intent( Intent.ACTION_PICK,
        new Uri( "content://contacts" ) 
    ),
    PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST 
);
</pre>
						Override onAcitvityResult() let you use the result of the called application, by using an Intent object.
					</li> 
				</ul>

		<h3> Manifest </h3>
		In software packaging, it is common to list the contents of a distribution in a manifest file. <br>
		In java this kind of file is used to specify information used when packing in a jar file :
		<ul>
			<li> 
				store hashes of stored files for signature validation. <br>
				This aspect will be deepened in the next charapter, "Packing Applications". 
			</li>
			<li> sealing jar files (i.e. ensure that only classes from this jar file are loaded in the packages defined in this jar file). </li>
			<li> store version/product/producer information to be readable at runtime </li>
		</ul>
		This file also contains information about the permission of the application. <br>
		The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is declared in its manifest's &ltactivity&gt tag. <br>
		Other applications will need to declare a corresponding &ltuses-permission&gt element in their own manifest to be able to start that activity. <br>

		<h3> Layout </h3>
		A layout defines the visual structure for a user interface, such as the UI for an activity or app widget. You can declare a layout in two ways:
		<ul>
			<li> 
				Declare UI elements in XML. <br>
				Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the View classes, such as those for widgets and layouts. 
			</li>
			<li> 
				Instantiate layout elements at runtime. <br>
				Your application can create View and ViewGroup objects (and manipulate their properties) programmatically. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		The Android framework allows you to use either or both of these methods for declaring and managing your application's UI. <br>
		For example, you could declare your application's default layouts, screen elements, and their properties in a XML file, <br> 
		and then modify the state of those object in yout code, at run time. <br>
