		Android target platform is ARM ( there is also an x86 implementation ). <br>
		It was initially developed by Android Inc., founded by Google and later bought in 2005, and <br>

		<h2> Resource Management </h2>
		One of the most important task which an OS takes care si the resource management. <br>
		The target is to assign resources to the processes, as efficiently and as quickly as possible. <br>
		Trying to prevent, of course, the formation on stalls. <br>
		In Android, this job is assigned, in a simple way, to the Linux Kernel.
