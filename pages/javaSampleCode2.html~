        <h1> A more Complex example, a Calculator </h1>
        <hr><br>

			No code, exactly, for layout reason, I prefer to not put it here, you can find it in the examples directory. <br>
			Note that the same example will be also proposed in Python later. <br>
			The code is also very easy to understand. <br>

			<h3> Problem Analisys </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Being this just a demo project, I prefer to maintain it as simple as possible. </li>
				<li> As you can see from the screenshot, we will use just two operators. </li>
				<li> We will support just the four basic operation. </li>
				<li> The user will eirte into two text-input widget, and click on a button to choose an operator. </li>
				<li> To commit the operation the user will click on the "=" button. </li>
			</ul>
