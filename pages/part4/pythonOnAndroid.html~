		Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, initially developed by Guido Van Rossum, in 1989. <br>
		In analogy with Java, is both compiled and interpreted, note that compilation could also come at runtime <br>
		Python source files ( *.py ) are compiled in bytecode, which is executed by an interpreter. <br>
		It is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. <br>
		Using third-party tools it can also be packaged into standalone executables. <br>
		<h3> In Pills </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Emphasize the readability </li>
			<li> Concise Syntax </li> 
			<li> Multi-Paradigm </li>
			<li> Duck Typing </li> 
			<li> No modifier, but Decorators </li> 
			<li> Completely Cross-Platform </li>  
		</ul>

		<h3>SL4A</h3>
		As mentioned, Python runs on an interpreter. <br>
		This allows to develop multiplatform code, just like Java. <br>
		The Scripting Layer for Android ( SL4A ) allows to run various script directly on Android devices. <br>
		Supported languages includes Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, JavaScript and so on... <br>
		SL4A is designed for developers and is still alpha quality software.

		<h3>Python for Android</h3>
		Python for android is a project to create your own Python distribution. <br>
		The software allows you to include all the modules you want and use them to compile and apk.
		
		<h3>Kivy</h3>

					Kivy is a cross-platform Python framework for rapid development of application. <br>
					Using python-for-android technology to create a python distribution that includes kivy <br>
					allows you to run the same application code on any Android device. <br>
					<b> All without modify a single line of code. </b> <br>
					This is possible because the framework itself is written in pure python. 
					<br>
					As many other frameworks do, kivy provides a set of classes for building the GUI,<br>
					but also to manage internal process and touch input. <br>
					However, Kivy comes with a further kind of approach. <br>
					Both GUI layout and widgets can be described using the Kv Language. <br>
					This technology is cross between UIML ( Layout definition ) and XML ( Structure definition ).
					The second approach makes kivy easily extensible.
