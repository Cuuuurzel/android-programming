				<td> Startup time </td>
				<td> Irrilevant. </td>

					It depends from the content of the Python distribution. <br>
					Heavy libraries, such as sympy, could take time for be unpacked!

				<td> Efficiency </td>
				<td colspan=2>
					Both the languages are compiled in Dalvik Bytecode. <br>
					The question then becomes delicate. <br>
					As Java is the "official language" for Android programming, it suppose to be more efficient. <br>

				<td> Support </td>
				<td>
					Java is a de-facto standar of development, both for desktop and mobile application. <br>
					Almost everything a programmer needs has yet be done.

					Kivy is yet stable but begins just in these days to be used. <br>
					That means there is a poor support for most things.
