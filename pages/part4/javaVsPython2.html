		<h3> Android SDK usage in Python </h3>
		If the SDK (and the NDK too) is written in Java, how is possible to use classes there declared? <br>

		<h3> Table of concepts </h3>
		<table width=100% border=1>
			<tr>
				<td><h3> How do you... </h3></td>
				<td><h3> Java </h3></td>
				<td><h3> Python </h3></td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...define a job for the DVM? </td> 
				<td> Using the <b>Activity</b> class. </td>
				<td> 
					Using the <b>App</b> class.
					<ul>
						<li>onCreate(Bundle) -> build() </li>
						<li>onPause(Bundle) -> on_pause() </li>
						<li>and so on... </li>
					</ul>					
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...interact with an other application?</td>
				<td> Using a <b>Bundle</b> object. </td>
				<td> Actually, there is no way of doing this. </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...handle touch events?</td>
				<td> <b>Overriding</b> the onTouchEvent method. </td>
				<td> 
					<b>Overriding</b> respectively :
					<ul>
						<li>on_touch_down</li>
						<li>on_touch_move</li>
						<li>on_touch_up</li>
					</ul>
					You also can grab a certain touch to a Widget.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...handle multi-touch events?</td>
				<td colspan=2> 
					Using the touch-event unique <b>id</b>.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...make 2D drawing?</td>
				<td> 
					You need to extend the View class and override <b>the onDraw(Canvas c)</b> method.
				</td>
				<td>
					Every Widget object as a canvas property, which you can treat in different ways :
					<ul>
						<li>Using <b>Kv-Language</b>, expecially for static things, in comfortable a separeted file.</li>
						<li>Using the Python <b>with</b> statement.</li>
						<li>Or using it as a python variable (not so widely used).</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> ...extend a widget?</td>
				<td> By <b>extending</b> the Widget class and <b>overriding</b> the onDraw() method. </td>
				<td> You have to extend a class, like in Java, then you will modify the canvas property as mentioned before. </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td rowspan=2> ...make 3D drawing?</td>
				<td colspan=2> 
					Of course, you will need to pass through OpenGL ES, which APIs are provided by the Application Framework. <br>
					In both languages however you will not have the same set of API you will have on a desktop app.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					Just use the classes of the OpenGL package in the NDK. <br>
					While it not differs a lot from JOGL or Java3D, you will have a different set of APIs. <br>
				</td>
				<td> 
					Kivy have its own OpenGL wrapper, which offers common APIs on every platform. <br>
					3D drawing is currently in a "beta" phase. <br>
					However, it does not have the same set of API of PyOpenGL.
				</td>
